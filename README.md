### Introduction

This notebook consists of 4 different datasets found on Kaggle. We will perform EDA, Data Wrangling, Make assumptions and gain Insights and create a simple model that will need to classify patients state of health. 

### Focus

* We will focus on discovering the difference between pandemic approach in Asian and Western countries
